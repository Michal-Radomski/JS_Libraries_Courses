Here is a concise comparison of **React Hook Form** and **Formik** based on their key differences:

| Aspect                    | React Hook Form                                                                                                                            | Formik                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**           | Uses uncontrolled components and refs, minimizing re-renders and improving performance, especially in large or complex forms[3][4][8][9].  | Uses controlled components, which can cause more frequent re-renders and slower performance with bigger forms[3][4][8][9].   |
| **Bundle Size**           | Much smaller (~4 KB gzipped), making it lightweight and suitable for performance-sensitive apps[2][8][9].                                  | Larger (~16 KB gzipped), which can impact load time in some cases[2][7].                                                     |
| **API and Boilerplate**   | Minimal boilerplate, uses hooks like `useForm`, and validation rules can be defined inline with `register`[4][8].                          | More boilerplate, uses `, `, and `` components, with validation often requiring a separate function or schema[7][8].         |
| **Form State Management** | Form state managed via hooks, focusing on isolated field updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders[3][6].                                    | Form state managed at form level, causing updates to cascade and potentially triggering more re-renders[3][6].               |
| **Validation**            | Supports built-in validation rules and easy integration with libraries like Yup; validation rules can be defined directly on inputs[4][6]. | Built-in validation support with Yup integration; validation logic often centralized in a validate function or schema[6][7]. |
| **Ease of Use**           | Slight learning curve due to use of uncontrolled components and refs, but rewards with simplicity and performance[8][9].                   | Generally easier to start with due to comprehensive documentation and built-in components, but can be verbose[7][8].         |
| **Flexibility**           | Minimalistic and flexible, integrates well with other UI libraries and custom components[4][6][8].                                         | More comprehensive feature set, including built-in field components and better suited for complex nested forms[6][7].        |
| **Maintenance**           | Actively maintained with community support[1].                                                                                             | Some concerns about maintenance and performance issues due to re-renders[1].                                                 |

### Summary

React Hook Form is preferred when performance, minimal bundle size, and fewer re-renders are priorities, especially for
complex or large forms. Formik offers a more comprehensive, beginner-friendly API with built-in components but can suffer
from performance bottlenecks and larger bundle size.

React Hook Form is generally considered the better choice for modern React apps focused on performance, while Formik remains
useful for projects that need its richer feature set or simpler initial learning curve[1][3][4][7][8][9].
