**Material Design Bootstrap** refers to the integration or adaptation of Google's **Material Design** principles and styles
within the **Bootstrap** framework.

### Explanation:

- **Material Design** is a design system developed by Google that emphasizes clean, modern aesthetics with depth effects such
  as shadows and animations, aiming for a consistent and intuitive user experience across platforms.
- **Bootstrap** is a popular front-end CSS framework focused on responsive grid layouts, utility classes, and pre-styled
  components for rapid web development.

**Material Design Bootstrap** combines these by either:

- Using Bootstrap’s grid system and utilities while applying Material Design styles and components, or
- Using third-party libraries or themes that bring Material Design look and feel to Bootstrap components.

This approach allows developers to leverage Bootstrap’s ease of use and responsiveness while achieving the modern, polished
appearance and interaction patterns defined by Material Design.

### Key Points:

- It is not an official Google product but rather a community-driven effort or theme to apply Material Design aesthetics on
  top of Bootstrap’s structure.
- It helps create visually consistent, mobile-friendly websites with the robust layout and component system of Bootstrap.
- Compared to pure Material UI (which is a React component library implementing Material Design), Material Design Bootstrap
  is more general-purpose and framework-agnostic, focusing on CSS and HTML.

### Summary:

Material Design Bootstrap is essentially **Bootstrap styled with Material Design principles**, enabling developers to build
responsive websites with the look and feel of Material Design while using Bootstrap’s familiar grid and components[1][4][5].

The difference between Material Design Bootstrap and React Bootstrap is primarily in their implementation and usage within
React projects:

### Material Design Bootstrap

- A theme or adaptation of Bootstrap to incorporate Google's Material Design styles.
- It generally involves using standard Bootstrap CSS classes and components but styled to look like Material Design.
- It might include custom CSS or third-party libraries to achieve the Material Design aesthetic within the Bootstrap
  framework.

### React Bootstrap

- A reimplementation of Bootstrap components as React components[4][5][6].
- Instead of relying on jQuery and traditional Bootstrap JavaScript, it uses React's component-based architecture[5][6].
- It allows you to use Bootstrap components in a React application in a "React-friendly" way, without directly manipulating
  the DOM[4].

### Key Differences

- **Implementation:** Material Design Bootstrap is more about styling an existing Bootstrap implementation, while React
  Bootstrap is about rewriting Bootstrap components to work natively in React[4][5][6].
- **React Dependency:** React Bootstrap is specifically designed for React projects, while Material Design Bootstrap can be
  used in any web project that uses Bootstrap, regardless of the JavaScript framework[4][5][6].
- **jQuery:** React Bootstrap does not depend on jQuery, whereas Material Design Bootstrap, if using standard Bootstrap,
  might still have jQuery as a dependency (though Bootstrap 5 has removed the jQuery dependency)[4].
- **Component Usage:** In React Bootstrap, you import and use React components. In Material Design Bootstrap, you're still
  writing HTML with Bootstrap CSS classes, but aiming for a Material Design look.

### Summary Table

| Feature           | Material Design Bootstrap                 | React Bootstrap                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Core Technology   | Bootstrap (CSS, JS) with Material styling | React components                          |
| React-Specific    | No, general web projects                  | Yes, for React projects                   |
| jQuery Dependency | Potentially (if using Bootstrap < 5)      | No                                        |
| Component Type    | HTML elements with CSS classes            | React components                          |
| Material Design   | Styling to resemble Material Design       | Bootstrap components implemented in React |

### Which to Choose?

- Use **React Bootstrap** if you are building a React application and want to use Bootstrap components in a React-idiomatic
  way, without jQuery[4][5][6].
- Use **Material Design Bootstrap** if you want to use Bootstrap’s grid and utilities but prefer the look and feel of
  Material Design, or if you're working on a non-React project but like Material Design[8].
