Here is a concise comparison of **Lodash** and **Underscore.js**, based on the search results:

## Similarities

- Both are popular JavaScript utility libraries providing functions for array/object manipulation, iteration, function
  binding, and functional programming helpers like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `groupBy`, and `sortBy`.
- Both support method chaining for concise and readable code.
- Lodash is backward-compatible with Underscore, so most Underscore code works with Lodash.

## Key Differences

| Feature                     | Underscore.js                                    | Lodash                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Size**                    | Smaller (~16KB), lightweight                     | Larger (~33KB full build), but supports modular builds to reduce size                                     |
| **Performance**             | Average speed, simpler implementation            | Generally faster and optimized, especially on large datasets                                              |
| **API & Features**          | Basic utility functions, less consistent API     | More consistent and intuitive API, additional utilities (e.g., deep cloning, string utils, flow, partial) |
| **Modularity**              | Single monolithic file                           | Modularized functions, allowing importing only needed parts                                               |
| **Nested Object Handling**  | Limited support for deep cloning and comparisons | Supports deep cloning (`cloneDeep`), merging, and more advanced object handling                           |
| **Chaining**                | Supports chaining but less elegant               | More powerful and easier chaining syntax                                                                  |
| **Compatibility & Updates** | Older, less active development                   | More actively maintained, supports newer JS features (ES6+)                                               |
| **Community & Usage**       | Smaller community, fewer downloads               | Larger community, more downloads, better documentation                                                    |

## Summary

- **Lodash** is a superset of Underscore with better performance, more features, modular imports, and improved API
  consistency.
- **Underscore** is lighter and simpler but lacks some advanced features and optimizations.
- Lodash is generally preferred today for new projects due to its richer feature set and active maintenance.

If you want a smaller bundle and only basic utilities, Underscore might suffice. For better performance, modularity, and more
utilities, Lodash is the better choice.
