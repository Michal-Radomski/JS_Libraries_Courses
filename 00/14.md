The main differences between Emotion and styled-components are in performance, flexibility, bundle size, and developer
experience:

- **Performance and Bundle Size:** Emotion is generally faster and has a smaller bundle size than styled-components. It is
  optimized for React Concurrent mode and offers more efficient runtime style processing and caching, which can lead to up to
  25 times faster performance in some cases. Emotion also provides a highly performant server-side rendering (SSR) solution
  with its `extractCritical` utility, improving page load times. Styled-components has improved its performance over time but
  still tends to be slower and larger in bundle size compared to Emotion[1][3].

- **Styling Syntax and Flexibility:** Styled-components uses a more traditional CSS-in-JS syntax with tagged template
  literals, which feels closer to writing regular CSS. It supports dynamic styling through props and has robust theming
  support via its `ThemeProvider`. Emotion offers greater flexibility by supporting both string (template literal) and object
  styles, as well as a `css` prop for inline styles, allowing more dynamic and composable styling patterns[1][4].

- **Theming:** Both libraries support theming with a `ThemeProvider`. Styled-components' theming is straightforward and
  widely used, while Emotion's theming integrates deeply with its `css` prop, enabling highly dynamic theming solutions[1].

- **Community and Ecosystem:** Styled-components has a larger community and ecosystem, which can be beneficial for support
  and resources. Emotion, while smaller, is growing and favored for performance-critical applications[1].

- **Developer Experience:** Emotion provides a developer-friendly approach with features like labels and source maps for
  easier debugging. Styled-components can sometimes make debugging harder because component names get replaced with class
  names in DevTools[1].

In summary, Emotion is preferred for better performance, smaller bundle size, and flexible styling options, especially in
performance-sensitive projects. Styled-components is favored for its familiar CSS syntax, strong theming, and larger
community support. The choice depends on project needs and personal preference[1][4].
