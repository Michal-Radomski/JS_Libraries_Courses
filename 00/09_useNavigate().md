The `navigate` function returned by React Router’s `useNavigate` hook supports several options and usage patterns beyond just
simple navigation to a path. Here are the main options and ways to use `navigate`:

## Basic Usage

```js
navigate(to, options);
```

- `to`: A string path or location object to navigate to.
- `options`: An optional object to customize navigation behavior.

## Options Object Properties

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replace`            | Boolean. If `true`, replaces the current entry in the history stack instead of pushing a new one. Similar to `history.replace`. |
| `state`              | Any data you want to pass to the destination route, accessible via `useLocation().state`.                                       |
| `preventScrollReset` | Boolean. If `true`, prevents scrolling to the top on navigation (useful for preserving scroll position).                        |
| `relative`           | String `"route"` or `"path"`. Controls how relative paths are resolved. Defaults to `"route"`.                                  |
| `flushSync`          | Boolean. If `true`, wraps the navigation state update in React’s `flushSync` to avoid batching delays.                          |
| `viewTransition`     | Boolean. Enables experimental view transition API if supported by the browser.                                                  |

## Navigation by Delta (History Movement)

You can also navigate through history entries by passing a number:

```js
navigate(-1); // Go back one page (like browser back button)
navigate(1); // Go forward one page
```

## Examples

### Navigate with state and replace

```js
navigate("/profile", { replace: true, state: { fromDashboard: true } });
```

### Navigate relative to route hierarchy

```js
navigate("../settings", { relative: "route" });
```

### Go back one page

```js
navigate(-1);
```

## Summary

The `navigate` function is versatile and supports:

- Navigating to a URL or location object.
- Passing state to the new location.
- Replacing history entries instead of pushing.
- Controlling scroll behavior.
- Relative path resolution modes.
- History traversal by delta (back/forward).

This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of navigation scenarios in React Router v6.
