## Difference Between Gatsby and React

- **React** is a JavaScript library primarily used for building dynamic user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs).
  It focuses on rendering UI components dynamically in the browser and offers great flexibility but requires manual setup for
  features like routing, SEO, and server-side rendering[3][5][10].

- **Gatsby** is a static site generator (SSG) built on top of React. It pre-renders React components into static HTML files
  at build time, optimizing for speed, SEO, and performance. Gatsby automates many tasks such as image optimization, code
  splitting, and SEO enhancements, and uses GraphQL to fetch data from multiple sources during build time[3][5][7][10][11].

### Key Differences

| Aspect        | React                                 | Gatsby                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Build dynamic, interactive UIs        | Build fast, SEO-friendly static websites                    |
| Rendering     | Client-side rendering by default      | Static site generation at build time                        |
| SEO           | Needs extra setup (SSR or frameworks) | SEO-friendly out of the box                                 |
| Performance   | Depends on app design                 | Optimized with automatic code splitting, image optimization |
| Data Handling | Dynamic data at runtime               | Data fetched at build time via GraphQL                      |
| Deployment    | Needs server or SSR setup for SEO     | Static files deployable on any CDN                          |
| Use Cases     | Complex apps with real-time data      | Blogs, marketing sites, documentation                       |

Gatsby is ideal when you want a fast, static site with great SEO and don’t need real-time dynamic content. React is better
suited for highly interactive applications with frequent data changes[1][3][5][9][10].

## How to Prepare a Very Simple Gatsby App: Example

### Steps to Create a Simple Gatsby App

1. **Install Gatsby CLI (if not installed):**

   ```bash
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. **Create a new Gatsby site:**

   ```bash
   gatsby new my-simple-site
   cd my-simple-site
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the browser at** `http://localhost:8000` to see your site.

### Example: Simple Gatsby Page

Create a file `src/pages/index.js` with this content:

```jsx
import * as React from "react"

export default function Home() {
  return (

      Welcome to My Simple Gatsby Site
      This is a basic Gatsby app using React components.

  )
}
```

This is a React component that Gatsby will statically render as the homepage.

### Summary

- Gatsby apps are React-based but generate static HTML at build time.
- You write React components as usual.
- Gatsby adds performance optimizations, SEO, and data fetching via GraphQL.
- The example above shows the minimal setup for a simple Gatsby site with one page[7][11][8].

This approach lets you build blazing fast static websites easily while leveraging React’s component model.
