The difference between **useNavigate** from `react-router-dom` and **useNavigation** from `react-router` lies mainly in their
purposes and usage contexts within React Router, especially across different versions.

### useNavigate (from react-router-dom)

- **Purpose:** It is a hook introduced in React Router v6 (in `react-router-dom`) that allows _imperative navigation_
  programmatically inside React components.
- **Usage:** You call `useNavigate()` to get a `navigate` function which you can use to navigate to a new route, replace the
  current route, or navigate back/forward in history.
- **Example:**

  ```jsx
  import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

  const MyComponent = () => {
    const navigate = useNavigate();

    const goToAbout = () => {
      navigate('/about');
    };

    return Go to About;
  };
  ```

- **Key features:**
  - Replaces the older `useHistory` hook from React Router v5.
  - Supports navigation with options like `replace` (to replace history entry), passing state, relative routing, and more.
  - Used for _imperative_ navigation triggered by events or effects.
- **When to use:** When you want to navigate programmatically in response to user actions, side effects, or complex
  conditions inside components[2][5][11][12].

### useNavigation (from react-router)

- This hook is part of React Router's newer data APIs (often associated with React Router v6.4+ and beyond).
- **Purpose:** It provides information about the current navigation state, such as whether a navigation is in progress,
  loading, or idle.
- **Usage:** It is used primarily for monitoring navigation status (e.g., loading spinners during route transitions), not for
  performing navigation actions.
- **Example:**

  ```jsx
  import { useNavigation } from 'react-router';

  const MyComponent = () => {
    const navigation = useNavigation();

    if (navigation.state === 'loading') {
      return Loading...;
    }

    return Content Loaded;
  };
  ```

- **Key features:**
  - Provides navigation state like `"idle"`, `"loading"`, or `"submitting"`.
  - Useful for showing UI feedback during route transitions.
- **When to use:** When you want to track or react to the navigation status within your app, especially in apps using React
  Router's data loading APIs[Note: This is based on React Router's evolving API and is distinct from useNavigate which is for
  triggering navigation].

### Summary Table

| Hook              | Package          | Purpose                                             | Usage                                                  | When to Use                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **useNavigate**   | react-router-dom | Imperative navigation (trigger route changes)       | Get a `navigate` function to programmatically navigate | Inside components to navigate on events or effects    |
| **useNavigation** | react-router     | Access navigation state (loading, idle, submitting) | Read navigation state to show loading UI or similar    | To monitor navigation status during route transitions |

### Additional Notes

- `useNavigate` is the primary hook for navigating programmatically in React Router DOM v6 and later.
- `useNavigation` is more specialized and tied to React Router's newer data APIs for managing navigation state.
- They serve **different roles**: one for _performing_ navigation, the other for _observing_ navigation state.

If you want to navigate users to different pages, use **useNavigate**. If you want to track or react to ongoing navigation
(like showing a loading spinner), use **useNavigation**.

This distinction is important to build responsive and user-friendly routing experiences in React applications.
