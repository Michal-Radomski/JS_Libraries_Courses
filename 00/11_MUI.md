The difference between Material UI (MUI) Base and Joy UI lies primarily in their design philosophy, customization
flexibility, and target use cases:

### Material UI Base

- **Foundation Layer:** MUI Base is an unstyled, low-level component library that provides hooks and logic without any
  default styles. It serves as a foundation for building fully custom components or as the base for other MUI libraries like
  Material UI and Joy UI[4].
- **Use Case:** Ideal for developers who want complete control over styles and want to build custom UI components from
  scratch without any imposed design or styling constraints[4].
- **No Default Styling:** It does not include any styling solution or default appearance, allowing maximum flexibility but
  requiring more work to style components[4].

### Joy UI

- **Mobile-First and Flexible Design:** Joy UI is a sister library to Material UI, focusing on mobile development and
  providing components designed specifically for mobile-friendly interfaces and touch interactions[1].
- **Design Philosophy:** Unlike Material UI, which strictly follows Google’s Material Design guidelines, Joy UI offers a more
  flexible and less opinionated design system called Joy Design. It emphasizes simplicity, visual appeal, and ease of
  customization using CSS variables[1][3][4].
- **Customization:** Joy UI features a simpler theming system that makes it easier to customize components globally or
  individually, aiming to empower developers to create unique, pixel-perfect designs without the constraints of Material
  Design[1][3].
- **Component Set:** While Joy UI has fewer components than Material UI, it includes unique components optimized for mobile
  and is designed to complement Material UI when used together[1].
- **Developer Experience:** Joy UI aims to provide a joyful developer experience with thoughtful defaults, accessibility
  features, and modern customization techniques[3].

### Summary Comparison

| Feature                     | Material UI Base                         | Joy UI                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Styling                     | Unstyled, no default styles              | Lightly opinionated, styled out of the box with Joy Design |
| Design System               | None (foundation for building custom UI) | Own design system, flexible and mobile-first               |
| Target Use Case             | Building fully custom components         | Mobile-friendly apps, flexible UI design                   |
| Customization               | Full control but requires manual styling | Easier theming and customization via CSS variables         |
| Component Scope             | Low-level hooks and unstyled components  | Ready-to-use UI components optimized for mobile            |
| Relationship to Material UI | Foundation for Material UI and Joy UI    | Sister library complementing Material UI                   |

### When to Use Which

- Use **Material UI Base** if you want to build your own design system or custom components from scratch with no styling
  constraints.
- Use **Joy UI** if you want a flexible, mobile-optimized, and easily customizable component library that does not follow
  Material Design strictly.
- For comprehensive web apps adhering to Material Design, use **Material UI** (not Base) itself.
- Joy UI and Material UI can be combined but require careful theme integration to avoid inconsistencies[1].

This distinction helps developers choose the right tool based on their project needs—whether for full custom design control
(Base), mobile-first flexibility (Joy UI), or Material Design adherence (Material UI).
