The main differences between RTK Query and React Query center around their integration with Redux, API design, setup
complexity, and use cases:

## Integration and Architecture

- **RTK Query** is built on top of Redux Toolkit and integrates tightly with Redux. It uses Redux slices and thunks to manage
  data fetching and caching within the Redux store. This makes it ideal for applications already using Redux for state
  management[3][6][9].
- **React Query** is a standalone library focused solely on server state management. It does not require Redux and manages
  its own cache independently, making it suitable for projects that want to keep data fetching separate from global state
  management[3][5][6].

## Setup and Usage

- **RTK Query** requires setting up an API slice with predefined endpoints in one central place. It involves more initial
  setup because it depends on Redux Toolkit's store configuration[1][5][9].
- **React Query** offers minimal setup; you can start using its hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) immediately without Redux
  or additional boilerplate. It provides more flexibility to define queries on the fly[1][5].

## API and Developer Experience

- **RTK Query** uses a Redux-style syntax with generated hooks like `useGetPostsQuery()`, which fits well for developers
  familiar with Redux patterns[5][6].
- **React Query** provides a more intuitive and flexible API with hooks like `useQuery(['posts'], fetchPosts)`, which many
  find easier if not using Redux[5][6].

## Caching and Performance

- **RTK Query** leverages the Redux store for caching and supports normalized caching, which is beneficial for large
  applications with complex data structures[5].
- **React Query** offers advanced caching, background data synchronization, and features like infinite scrolling and
  pagination. It also supports React Suspense for concurrent rendering[5][6].

## Mutations and Refetching

- Both libraries support optimistic updates, retries, and refetching, but React Query's mutation API is considered simpler
  and more flexible[5][6].

## When to Choose Which

- Use **RTK Query** if your app already uses Redux and you want tight integration between data fetching and state management.
- Use **React Query** if you want a lightweight, standalone solution for server state management without the complexity of
  Redux[3][5][6][7].

In summary, RTK Query is a Redux-centric data fetching tool that fits naturally into Redux apps with centralized API
definitions, while React Query is a more flexible, standalone library focused purely on server state management with minimal
setup. Both provide powerful caching and synchronization features but cater to different project architectures and developer
preferences.
