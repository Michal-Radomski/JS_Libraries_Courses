Here's a detailed comparison of React-Bootstrap, Material-UI (MUI), and Ant Design based on their features, customization,
design, documentation, and typical use cases:

| Aspect                     | React-Bootstrap                                                            | Material-UI (MUI)                                                             | Ant Design                                                              |

### Summary

- **React-Bootstrap** is best if you want a familiar Bootstrap experience with React components, easy responsiveness, and
  straightforward usage, especially if you don't need heavy customization.
- **Material-UI (MUI)** suits projects that want a modern Material Design aesthetic and are ready to invest time in learning
  customization for a unique UI.
- **Ant Design** excels in enterprise applications with a polished, professional look, rich component set, and powerful
  customization, ideal for data-heavy apps and dashboards.

If you prioritize ease of use and Bootstrap familiarity, go with React-Bootstrap. For a modern, customizable design aligned
with Google's Material Design, choose Material-UI. For enterprise-level features, elegant design, and extensive components,
Ant Design is recommended[2][3][4][5][6][7].
